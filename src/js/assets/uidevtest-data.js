        "title": "Tiny microgreens packed with nutrients",
        "story": "<p>They may be tiny, but a new study shows trendy microgreens punch well above their weight when it comes to nutrition.</p> <p>Researchers found microgreens like red cabbage, cilantro, and radish contain up to 40 times higher levels of vital nutrients than their mature counterparts.</p> <p>Microgreens are young seedlings of edible vegetables and herbs harvested less than 14 days after germination. They are usually about 1-3 inches long and come in a rainbow of colors, which has made them popular in recent years as garnishes with chefs.</p> <p>Although nutritional claims about microgreens abound on the Internet, this study is the first scientific evaluation of their nutritional content. Researchers say they were astonished by the results.</p> <p>&ldquo;The microgreens were four- to 40-fold more concentrated with nutrients than their mature counterparts,&rdquo; says researcher Qin Wang, PhD, assistant professor at the University of Maryland in College Park. &ldquo;When we first got the results we had to rush to double and triple check them.&rdquo;</p> <p>For example, red cabbage microgreens had 40 times more vitamin E and six times more vitamin C than mature red cabbage. Cilantro microgreens had three times more beta-carotene mature cilantro.</p> <p><strong>Microgreens Pack Nutritional Punch</strong></p> <p>Researchers evaluated levels of four groups of vital nutrients, including vitamin K, vitamin C, vitamin E, lutein, and beta-carotene, in 25 different commercially grown microgreens.</p> <p>The results are published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.</p> <p>Vitamin C, vitamin K, and vitamin E levels were highest among red cabbage, garnet amaranth, and green daikon radish microgreens.</p> <p>Cilantro microgreens were richest in terms of lutein and beta-carotene.</p> <p>&ldquo;All of these nutrients are extremely important for skin, eyes, and fighting cancer and have all sorts of benefits associated with them,&rdquo; says researcher Gene Lester, PhD, of the USDA.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lester said he was surprised to find microgreens were superior in nutritional value than the mature plants.</p> <p>&ldquo;To find that the levels were not only detectible but in some cases 4-6 times more concentrated than in the leaves of a mature plant, I find that quite astonishing.&rdquo;</p> <p>Although more research is needed, Wang says there may be a good explanation for microgreens&rsquo; high nutrient content.</p> <p>&ldquo;Because microgreens are harvested right after germination, all the nutrients they need to grow are there,&rdquo; says Wang. &ldquo;If they are harvested at the right time they are very concentrated with nutrients, and the flavor and texture is also good.&rdquo;</p> <p><strong>A Little Goes a Long Way</strong></p> <p>Experts say the flavor of microgreens is also more intense, so a little goes a long way to enhance a meal.</p> <p>Until recently, commercially grown microgreens have only been available to chefs, who use them as flavor accents and garnishes for soups, salads, and sandwiches.</p> <p>Today, they are available at most farmers markets and upscale grocery stores.</p> <p>They generally cost more than mature greens, but registered dietitian Roberta Duyff says that shouldn&rsquo;t discourage people from eating them.</p> <p>They are quick and easy to grow indoors on a sunny windowsill and are a great project for kids, says Duyff, who is the author of the American Dietetic Association Complete Food and Nutrition Guide.</p> <p>&ldquo;They are little, and kids like things that are kid&rsquo;s size,&rdquo; Duyff says. &ldquo;They can put it on their own salad or some cheese or hummus to make it look pretty.&rdquo;</p> <p>Like most spices and herbs that are also highly concentrated with nutrients, she says you don&rsquo;t need much to add flavor and spark to the plate.</p> <p>Duyff says microgreens are extremely delicate and, like any raw vegetable, need to be washed carefully before eating. Due to their high water content, cooking microgreens isn&rsquo;t recommended.</p> <p>When choosing a microgreen, researchers say to look for the most intensely colored ones, which will be the most nutritious.</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really kind of an artistic thing currently, but it&rsquo;s nice to know that not only do microgreens look pretty and have strong flavor, but they also have an incredible punch of nutrition,&rdquo; says Lester.</p> <p>SOURCES: Xiao, Z.

        "story": "<p>A school in San Francisco's Visitacion Valley neighborhood reopened Tuesday morning after a weeklong closure prompted by flooding from a large water main that ruptured nearby, according to school officials.</p> <p>The 42-inch pipe broke at about 11:10 a.m. on Aug. 28 on Sunnydale Avenue between Cora Street and Tomaso Court, sending water gushing into several nearby homes and the Our Lady of the Visitacion School, a K-8 school at 785 Sunnydale Ave.</p> <p>The water damaged multiple classrooms, as well as the school's gymnasium and administrative offices and a convent for the Church of the Visitacion, which is associated with the school.</p> <p>School principal Maxie O'Rourke said in a letter sent to parents and posted on the school's website that experts determined the campus was safe to reopen after tests were done to check for mildew, mold and moisture.</p> <p>Any carpets or furniture that were soaked by the water were removed from the school, and fans were brought in to dry out any leftover moisture, O'Rourke said.</p> <p>Over the weekend, construction crews finished repairing a gaping hole in the street that was created by the rupture, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission spokeswoman Alison Kastama said.</p> <p>The street was repaired Saturday, allowing normal San Francisco Municipal Railway bus service to resume in that area on Sunday, Kastama said.</p> <p>Crews will have to return to the site at a later date to dig up the road again to replace the 42-inch pipe, she said. Water service is back to normal for all residents in the area.</p> <p>The cost of the water main break has yet to be determined. Residents who sustained property damage have a year to file a claim with the city attorney's office. They can do so by calling (415) 554-3900.</p> <p>The cause of the rupture remains under investigation, and SFPUC officials have said it appears to be unrelated to a yearlong sewer project in the neighborhood that had wrapped up a short time earlier.</p> <p>Anyone seeking information about the incident can call the SFPUC at (415) 554-3289. Updates will also be posted online at www.sfwater.org.</p>",

        "story": "<p>The California State University faculty has overwhelmingly approved a new four-year labor contract, ending more than two years of contentious bargaining with the administration, the union said Tuesday.</p> <p>Lillian Taiz, president of the California Faculty Association, said the contract, which largely preserves current working conditions and contains no salary raises, won 91 percent of approval by voting members.</p> <p>About 45 percent of the union's 12,500 voting members cast ballots over several weeks last month. Many faculty members were out of town on research assignments, Taiz said.</p> <p>The contract, which must still be ratified by the university's board of trustees at its meeting later this month, covers 23,000 professors, lecturers and other professional employees throughout CSU's 23 campuses. Not all are voting members.</p> <p>John Swarbrick, associate vice chancellor for labor relations, said in a statement that he was pleased that the union has passed the agreement and added that he expects the board to also ratify it.</p> <p>Faculty members have been working without a contract for the last 2 1/2 years during a contentious bargaining process that spurred a strike-authorization vote and intervention of a mediator last spring.</p> <p>With that issue now resolved, Taiz said faculty will be fully engaged in lobbying for passage of Proposition 30, which calls for increasing the sales tax and income taxes for the wealthy to raise funds for public education. If the measure fails in November, CSU will lose $250 million starting in January.</p> <p>\"It's one of those moments, and it doesn't happen too often, when faculty and the board are on the same page,\" Taiz said. \"We are 100 percent engaged in what happens next.\"</p> <p>With class sizes increasing, no pay raises for four years, and program cuts that threaten jobs, employees said morale is low on campuses.</p> <p>\"The faculty are feeling fairly beaten down,\" said Jonathan Karpf, an anthropology lecturer at San Jose State University. \"But the majority are feeling better that we've reached an agreement.\"</p> <p>The changes in the new contract are modest. Most of the union's battle was to preserve items the university wanted to cut. More than $750 million has been cut from CSU's budget over the past three years.</p>",

        "story": "<p>It could be a week before firefighters can contain a 3,600-acre blaze in the Angeles National Forest because of high temperatures and rugged terrain in thick brush that hasn't burned in a couple of decades.</p> <p>The cause of the fire that started Sunday afternoon in the San Gabriel Mountains, spoiling holiday hiking and camping plans for thousands, has not been determined, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said.</p> <p>A burned car was found in the area, but it isn't clear if it started the fire or was just destroyed by the flames, officials said.</p> <p>No structures have burned. Five minor firefighter injuries have been reported, four for heat and one twisted ankle, said Calfire Incident Cmdr. James Smith. No one has been hospitalized.</p> <p>Fire conditions early Tuesday were good, with temperatures in the upper 60s, 6-mph winds and humidity at 20 percent, Smith said.</p> <p>Resources on the fire include four air tankers, 10 helicopters, 40 engines, eight dozers, 25 hand crews and five water tenders, he said.</p> <p>Campgrounds that typically attract up to 12,000 visitors on the holiday weekend, as well as rehabilitation centers and a private mobile home community of Camp Williams Resort, were evacuated Sunday but some stuck around.</p> <p>\"Twenty-five people have elected to stay in place regardless of the evacuation order,\" Smith said.</p> <p>Daniel Burress, 68, known to park residents as \"Grandpa,\" said he has never evacuated, even when wildfires were far closer.</p> <p>\"I'm a Vietnam vet,\" Burress told the Los Angeles Times. \"So this doesn't scare me at all.\"</p> <p>Officials said campgrounds, while not in the line of the fire, had to be emptied so the only road in and out of the San Gabriel Canyon could be open just for fire trucks and emergency vehicles.</p> <p>The area burned is about 5 1/2 square miles. The latest update Tuesday estimated the fire to be 15 percent contained, Smith said.</p> <p>The reason it will take so long to circle the fire is because the basic firefight is taking place from the air, Capt. Roland Spreewell told KTTV-TV. \"It's hard to get boots on the ground\" because of the \"billy goat\" conditions, he said, explaining that much of the fire area had slopes of 30 percent to 80 percent.</p> <p>The National Weather Service said the next seven days will be seasonably warm with some moisture from a couple of tropical storms in Mexico. There is a chance of precipitation in the area and maybe a thunderstorm, but those chances aren't great, said meteorologist Mike Wofford.</p> <p>In Northern California, firefighters spent Monday focusing on the rugged and remote northern edge of a weeks-old fire in Mendocino County. That blaze has scorched more than 65 square miles.</p> <p>At least two other fires were contained Monday shortly after they started: a 150-acre brush fire in hills between Concord and Pittsburg on Northern California and a 100-acre blaze in Fountain Springs near Porterville in Southern California.</p>",
